course project for cs230 deep learning at Stanford

CS230-HandWrittenChineseCharacterReM1 -- the basic 4-layer DL model for milestone 1, running locally on my mac, took about 3h. Since the number of classes is over 3000, it will be really slow for this simply model

Everything else was build after milestone 1.
